   When I started developing this library, I wasn't just making it for myself, but for all of the FlatRedBall developers.  I wanted to give an easy to use, very flexible library that can give the developers the tools they need to create a great game.

   If you want to help with the development library, please post issues you find, suggest features, or just let me know that you are using this library for your game.  Anything will be greatly appreciated.
